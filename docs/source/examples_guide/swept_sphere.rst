Swept Sphere
============

**Example script**: ``examples/swept_sphere.py``

This example demonstrates swept sphere collision detection for robot links.

Source Code

https://github.com/iory/scikit-robot/blob/main/examples/swept_sphere.py

What This Example Shows
========================

- Computing swept sphere representations of robot links
- Efficient collision detection using spheres
- Visualizing collision geometry

Key Concepts
============

Swept spheres approximate robot links as a series of spheres, enabling:

- Fast collision checking
- Smooth distance calculations
- Efficient motion planning

This representation is particularly useful for real-time collision detection and trajectory optimization.
