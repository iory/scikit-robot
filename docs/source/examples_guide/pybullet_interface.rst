What This Example Shows
========================

- PyBullet simulation setup
- Sending angle vectors to simulated robots
- Physics simulation integration
- Same API as real robot control

Key Features
============

The PyBullet interface provides the same API as the ROS interface, making it easy to:

- Test robot motions in simulation before deploying to hardware
- Develop and debug control algorithms safely
- Visualize robot behavior with physics
